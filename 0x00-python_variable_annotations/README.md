# Python - Variable Annotations

Hey there! Let's embark dive into the world of Python variable annotations. This README is here to guide us through understanding type annotations in Python 3, how we can elevate our code's readability and maintainability, and how tools like `mypy` can help validate our code. Let's dive right in!

## Type Annotations in Python 3

Type annotations are a way for us to explicitly declare the type of variables, function parameters, and return values in our Python code. Introduced in Python 3.5, they provide clarity and allow us to catch type-related errors early in the development process.

Here's a quick example to demonstrate how type annotations look in Python:

```python
# Variable annotation
name: str = "John"

# Function annotation
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return "Hello, " + name
```

In this snippet, we've annotated the variable `name` as a string (`str`) and the function `greet` to accept a string parameter and return a string.

## Using Type Annotations for Function Signatures and Variable Types

Type annotations not only make our code more readable but also serve as documentation for other developers (and our future selves!) to understand what types are expected.

```python
# Function with type annotations
def add(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    return x + y

result: int = add(3, 5)
print(result)  # Output: 8
```

In this example, we've annotated the `add` function to accept two integers (`int`) as parameters and return an integer. This clarity makes it evident what types of arguments the function expects and what it will return.

## Duck Typing

Python is often praised for its flexibility, and this extends to its typing system. Duck typing is a concept where the type or class of an object is less important than the methods it defines. In other words, "If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck."

```python
class Duck:
    def quack(self):
        print("Quack!")

class Person:
    def quack(self):
        print("I'm not a duck, but I can quack!")

def make_sound(entity):
    entity.quack()

duck = Duck()
person = Person()

make_sound(duck)    # Output: Quack!
make_sound(person)  # Output: I'm not a duck, but I can quack!
```

Here, both the `Duck` and `Person` classes have a `quack` method. Even though they are different types, as long as they implement the required method, they can be passed to `make_sound`.

## Validating Our Code with Mypy

`mypy` is a static type checker for Python that can analyze our code and detect type-related errors before we even run it. It's like having an extra set of eyes to catch potential bugs!

First, let's install `mypy` using pip:

```bash
pip install mypy
```

Then, we can run it on our Python files:

```bash
mypy your_code.py
```

If everything is good, it won't output anything. But if it finds any type errors, it will let us know so we can fix them before they cause runtime issues.

```bash
your_code.py:5: error: Argument 1 to "add" has incompatible type "str"; expected "int"
```

That's it! We're now equipped with the knowledge of Python variable annotation, function signatures, duck typing, and how to validate our code using `mypy`. Keep practicing, experimenting, and happy coding! üöÄüêç
